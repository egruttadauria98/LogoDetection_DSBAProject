    "1. You have inserted the images for which you want your annotations to be predicted inside the **INFERENCE_DIR** folder.\n",
    "2. You have added a file named **annotations.csv** to the **ANNOTATIONS&PREDICTIONS** folder, if you want your ground-truth annotations to be compared to the predictions made by our model.\n",
